        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manager Interface.</strong> The manager interface streamlines communication between employees
                and suppliers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Employee Interface.</strong> Employees fill in a series of digital forms which log important
                information about the processes they complete in their work.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Process Mining.</strong> Data will be piped through a process mining application and the results
                will be forwarded to the
                manager's dashboard.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Manager Dashboard.</strong> An exclusive manager dashboard will allow them to track key
                productivity metrics and highlight employee engagement, as well as visualize the business processes to
                identify bottlenecks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The end project will be the technical implication of the product (as described above) using tools
            such as Docker, shell scripts, and a Flask REST API webserver.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we also want to provide a testing framework with simulated users and managers using a
            tool such as PySelenium.</p>

        <h3>üë§ User Experience (UX) Design</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that we
            need to define our user and figure out more specific details regarding their current work-flows,
            including the services and platforms they use. We'll also take a look at the approaches being employed
            by others with similarities to our product.</p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <h5>Surveys</h5>
        <p>Surveys, especially those with no follow-up questions, provide
            quantitative data from which we can analyze responses to recognize patterns.</p>
        <p>You can find a report of the survey by opening <a href="assets/usability-report.pdf">this PDF file</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Analyze</h4>
        <p>We can take the raw data we gathered from our interview (transcript omitted for confidentiality) and surveys
            to define our target user's behaviour and
            attitudes.</p>
        <h5>Use Cases</h5>
        <p>Use cases can be defined with a jobs to be done (JTBD) template that follows a situation, motivation,
            expected outcome format</p>
