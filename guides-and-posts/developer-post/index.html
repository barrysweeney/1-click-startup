        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manager Interface.</strong> The manager interface streamlines communication between employees
                and suppliers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Employee Interface.</strong> Employees fill in a series of digital forms which log important
                information about the processes they complete in their work.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Process Mining.</strong> Data will be piped through a process mining application and the results
                will be forwarded to the
                manager's dashboard.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Manager Dashboard.</strong> An exclusive manager dashboard will allow them to track key
                productivity metrics and highlight employee engagement, as well as visualize the business processes to
                identify bottlenecks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The end project will be the technical implication of the product (as described above) using tools
            such as Docker and a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> REST API webserver.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we also want to provide a testing framework with simulated users and managers using a
            tool such as <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">PySelenium</a>.</p>

        <h3>ü§ñ Automation</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>User experience design details are listed below but for now I feel like it's worth skipping ahead to
            our first glimpse at automating our user, and work backwards from there.</p>
        <p>As one of the main goals of this project is to create automated users, it's worth exploring an example of one
            of the tasks that have been automated. </p>
        <p>We'll have <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">PySelenium</a> interact with our user interface
            to populate and submit a form to our backend <a
                    href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/">Flask</a>
            webserver which will then store data in a sqlite3 database.</p>
        <p><span aria-label="stop sign emoji">üõë</span> Hold Up <span aria-label="hand up for stop emoji">‚úã </span>Before
            we go any further I'd like to mention that it isn't essential to understand concepts like <a
                    href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">containers</a> and <a
                    href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/">Docker
                compose network</a> at this point. When a new concept pops up I'll make sure to link to it's
            documentation for future
            reference. For now feel free to gloss over it and just get a feel for the overall flow of data and how our
            different services communicate. As an aside, the best resource I've found for learning these concepts was <a
                    href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/docker-kubernetes-big-picture">this course</a> which you
            can watch on a PluralSight free trial.</p>
        <p>In fact before we dive into code, let's set the scene with an analogy: We can think of containers as rooms in
            our hotel, and our "Docker network" as our hallway that connects all of our rooms. Our localhost is our
            hotel reception (or lobby if you watched a lot of Suite Life of Zach and Cody).</p>
        <p>When we run <code>sudo docker-compose up</code> we're starting different containers relating to our
            application.</p>
        <p>We're getting our rooms ready and letting our guests into them.</p>
        <p>Our automated user lives in one of these containers/rooms. With the following line of code, they can get the
            webdriver for Selenium which allows them to access the web.</p>
        <p>They walk down the corridor to the <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium">Webdriver</a> room
            to get the key for the door to the Web Browser room.</p>
        <pre>
        <code>driver = webdriver.Remote(<span class="red-code">desired_capabilities</span>=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX,
            <span class="red-code">command_executor</span>=<span
                    class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:4444/wd/hub"</span>)</code></pre>
        <p>We use <span class="green-code">http://172.17.0.1</span> instead of <span
                class="green-code">http://localhost</span>
            since we're communicating from within one container to a different container (on port 4444 of the same
            Docker network... same hallway)</p>
        <p>With the next line of code our automated employee can access the customer order page of the frontend user
            interface which is in a different container accessible at port 8000 on our Docker network.</p>
        <pre><code>driver.get(<span class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:8000/customer-order"</span>)</code></pre>
        <p>This is what our employee now sees:</p>
        <img src="assets/customer-order.png" alt="Customer Order form"/>
        <p>They can now fill in and submit the form:</p>
        <pre><code>
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-name"</span>).send_keys(<span class="green-code">"John Doe"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-contact-number"</span>).send_keys(<span
                class="green-code">"+44700000010"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-contact-number"</span>).send_keys("<span
                class="green-code">Bottle Water"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"submit-customer-order"</span>).click()
        </code></pre>
        <p>If we look at the code for this form we can see that it is sending a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)">POST</a> request to our backend Flask
            webserver running on port 5000 of our Docker network (We take the letter we wrote in the frontend room to
            Flask's room).</p>
        <pre><code><span class="yellow-code">&lt;form</span> method=<span class="green-code">"post"</span> action=<span
                class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:5000/customer/order/new"</span><span
                class="yellow-code">&gt;</span>...</code></pre>
        <p>Let's look at what's happening over on the server side by visiting our Flask webserver.</p>
        <pre><code>
<span class="yellow-code">@app.route</span>(<span class="green-code">'/customer/order/new'</span><span
                class="orange-code">,</span> <span class="red-code">methods</span>=[<span
                class="green-code">'post'</span>])
<span class="orange-code">def</span> <span class="yellow-code">customer_order</span>():
    name = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-name'</span>]
    contact_number = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-contact-number'</span>]
    order = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-order'</span>]
    c.execute(<span class="green-code">"</span><span class="orange-code">INSERT INTO</span> CUSTOMER_ORDER(CUSTOMER_NAME,CONTACT_NUMBER,CUSTOMER_ORDER) \
    <span class="orange-code">VALUES</span> (?<span class="orange-code">,</span>?<span
                class="orange-code">,</span>?)<span class="green-code">"</span><span
                class="orange-code">,</span> (name<span class="orange-code">,</span> contact_number<span
                class="orange-code">,</span> order<span class="orange-code">,</span>))
    conn.commit()
    <span class="orange-code">return</span> <span class="green-code">'OK'</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>We're extracting the data from the form that was posted and inserting it as an new record into our customer
            order table.</p>
        <p>We can see that Flask and sqlite3 share the same room, if it start's getting too crowded we might want to
            prepare a new room for sqlite3</p>
        <p>Although this is only a single <a href="#use-cases">use case</a>, that of an employee taking a customer
            order, it highlights the flow of data through some of our integrated services.</p>

    <div class="process-mining">
        <h3>‚õè Process Mining</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>As users of 1 Click Startup perform various tasks they leave a log of data which we can mine to analyze
            processes and workflows. We can pip the results of our process mining to the manager's dashboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="User Experience">
        <h3>üë§ User Experience (UX) Design</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that we
            need to define our user and figure out more specific details regarding their current work-flows,
            including the services and platforms they use. We'll also take a look at the approaches being employed
            by others with similarities to our product.</p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <h5>Surveys</h5>
        <p>Surveys, especially those with no follow-up questions, provide
            quantitative data from which we can analyze responses to recognize patterns.</p>
        <p>You can find a report of the survey by opening <a href="assets/usability-report.pdf">this PDF file</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Analyze</h4>
        <p>We can take the raw data we gathered from our interview (transcript omitted for confidentiality) and surveys
            to define our target user's behaviour and
            attitudes.</p>
        <h5 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h5>
        <p>Use cases can be defined with a jobs to be done (JTBD) template that follows a situation, motivation,
            expected outcome format</p>

        <h5>Personas</h5>
        <p>We capture the the common behaviours that meaningfully characterize each user into a persona. In our case
            we'll have a persona for both a manager and an employee since their needs will be very different.</p>
