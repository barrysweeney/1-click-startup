        <hr/>
        <p>Before we dive in to the short steps to get up and running we'll briefly mention the prerequisite tools.</p>
        <p>Experienced developers can <a href="#quickstart">jump ahead to the quickstart</a>.</p>
        <p id="prereq">It may seem like a lot of initial setup if you're new to the tools but it'll be well worth it.
            Getting
            familiar with these tools will put you in good stead to take your ability as a software engineer to the next
            level and will set you apart from others interviewing for entry-level software engineering jobs.</p>
        <p>From <a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Docker</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its
            environment, solving the ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù headache. For millions of developers today, Docker is the
            de
            facto standard to build and share containerized apps - from desktop, to the cloud."
        </blockquote>
        <p>From <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Selenium automates browsers. That's it!
            What you do with that power is entirely up to you.

            Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just
            that.

            Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well."
        </blockquote>
        <p>From <a href="https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/">Python Basic - What is Flask Python?</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Flask is a web application framework written in Python.

            A Web Application Framework or simply a
            Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and
            modules that enable web application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level
            details such as protocol, thread management, and so on."

        <p>From <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/introduction-to-git">The Odin
            Project - Introduction to Git</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Git is like a really epic save button for your files and directories. Officially, Git is a version
            control system.

            Git is useful for creating snapshots of your work. If you realize halfway through that you've messed up,
            it's much easier to reset.

            Git and GitHub are useful for teams because they can merge code together. A developer can work on one part
            of the code while a second developer works on another part. They can then use Git and GitHub to easily
            combine their changes."

        <hr/>
        <p>User experience design details are listed below but for now I feel like it's worth skipping ahead to
            our first glimpse at automating our user, and work backwards from there.</p>
        <p>As one of the main goals of this project is to create automated users, it's worth exploring an example of one
            of the tasks that have been automated. </p>
        <p>We'll have <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">PySelenium</a> interact with our user interface
            to populate and submit a form to our backend <a
                    href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/">Flask</a>
            webserver which will then store data in a sqlite3 database.</p>
        <p><span aria-label="stop sign emoji">üõë</span> Hold Up <span aria-label="hand up for stop emoji">‚úã </span>Before
            we go any further I'd like to mention that it isn't essential to understand concepts like <a
                    href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">containers</a> and <a
                    href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/">Docker
                compose network</a> at this point. When a new concept pops up I'll make sure to link to it's
            documentation for future
            reference. For now feel free to gloss over it and just get a feel for the overall flow of data and how our
            different services communicate. As an aside, the best resource I've found for learning these concepts was <a
                    href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/docker-kubernetes-big-picture">this course</a> which you
            can watch on a PluralSight free trial.</p>
        <p>In fact before we dive into code, let's set the scene with an analogy: We can think of containers as rooms in
            our hotel, and our "Docker network" as our hallway that connects all of our rooms. Our localhost is our
            hotel reception (or lobby if you prefer).</p>
        <p>When we run <code>sudo docker-compose up</code> we're starting different containers relating to our
            application.</p>
        <p>We're getting our rooms ready and letting our guests into them.</p>
        <p>Our automated user lives in one of these containers/rooms. With the following line of code, they can get the
            webdriver for Selenium which allows them to access the web.</p>
        <p>They walk down the corridor to the <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium">Webdriver</a> room
            to get the key for the door to the Web Browser room.</p>
        <pre>
        <code>driver = webdriver.Remote(<span class="red-code">desired_capabilities</span>=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX,
            <span class="red-code">command_executor</span>=<span
                    class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:4444/wd/hub"</span>)</code></pre>
        <p>We use <span class="green-code">http://172.17.0.1</span> instead of <span
                class="green-code">http://localhost</span>
            since we're communicating from within one container to a different container, for more information about
            this bridge between networks using the host machine you can refer to <a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48546124/9472445">this StackOverflow question by user klor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>With the next line of code our automated employee can access the customer order page of the frontend user
            interface which is in a different container accessible at port 8000 on our Docker network.</p>
        <pre><code>driver.get(<span class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:8000/customer-order"</span>)</code></pre>
        <p>This is what our employee now sees:</p>
        <img src="assets/customer-order.png" alt="Customer Order form"/>
        <p>They can now fill in and submit the form:</p>
        <pre><code>
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-name"</span>).send_keys(<span class="green-code">"John Doe"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-contact-number"</span>).send_keys(<span
                class="green-code">"+44700000010"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"customer-contact-number"</span>).send_keys("<span
                class="green-code">Bottle Water"</span>)
    driver.find_element_by_id(<span class="green-code">"submit-customer-order"</span>).click()
        </code></pre>
        <p>If we look at the code for this form we can see that it is sending a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)">POST</a> request to our backend Flask
            webserver running on port 5000 of our Docker network (We take the letter we wrote in the frontend room to
            Flask's room).</p>
        <pre><code><span class="yellow-code">&lt;form</span> method=<span class="green-code">"post"</span> action=<span
                class="green-code">"http://172.17.0.1:5000/customer/order/new"</span><span
                class="yellow-code">&gt;</span>...</code></pre>
        <p>Let's look at what's happening over on the server side by visiting our Flask webserver.</p>
        <pre><code>
<span class="yellow-code">@app.route</span>(<span class="green-code">'/customer/order/new'</span><span
                class="orange-code">,</span> <span class="red-code">methods</span>=[<span
                class="green-code">'post'</span>])
<span class="orange-code">def</span> <span class="yellow-code">customer_order</span>():
    name = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-name'</span>]
    contact_number = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-contact-number'</span>]
    order = request.form[<span class="green-code">'customer-order'</span>]
    c.execute(<span class="green-code">"</span><span class="orange-code">INSERT INTO</span> CUSTOMER_ORDER(CUSTOMER_NAME,CONTACT_NUMBER,CUSTOMER_ORDER) \
    <span class="orange-code">VALUES</span> (?<span class="orange-code">,</span>?<span
                class="orange-code">,</span>?)<span class="green-code">"</span><span
                class="orange-code">,</span> (name<span class="orange-code">,</span> contact_number<span
                class="orange-code">,</span> order<span class="orange-code">,</span>))
    conn.commit()
    <span class="orange-code">return</span> <span class="green-code">'OK'</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>We're extracting the data from the form that was posted and inserting it as an new record into our customer
            order table.</p>
        <p>We can see that Flask and sqlite3 share the same room, if it start's getting too crowded we might want to
            prepare a new room for sqlite3</p>
        <p>Although this is only a single <a href="#use-cases">use case</a>, that of an employee taking a customer
            order, it highlights the flow of data through some of our integrated services.</p>

        <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that we

        <h4>Research</h4>
