        <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that, we
            need to define our user, and figure out more specific details regarding their current work-flows.</p>
        <p>After conducting a survey with Google forms and an in person interview with a local business owner, the
            following use cases have been identified. These are jobs we want to incorporate into our product to improve

        <p>If we think about completing these tasks in terms of webpages, we see that for communication or
            record keeping we can provide forms on the user interface, but for tasks which need performed physically -
            such
            as turning off equipment - we can just provide a form to report that the task has been completed.</p>
        <p>Open source software can enable us to automate some of the tasks required to run the business. Stock could be
            automatically re-ordered for example. Open source document editing services could also be employed.</p>

        <h3>🛫 Getting the current system up and running</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p id="prereq">It may seem like a lot of initial setup if you're new to the tools, but it'll be well worth it.
            Getting
            familiar with these tools will put you in good stead to take your ability as a software engineer to the next
            level, and will set you apart from others interviewing for entry-level software engineering jobs and
            beyond.</p>
        <p>Note that while some commands and screenshots are Linux based, they can be easily mapped to MacOS and
            Windows, and I'll provide links throughout to other guides which demonstrate how to install certain tools on
            non-linux based operating systems.</p>
        <h4>Set up Git and GitHub</h4>
        <p>We'll begin by getting the necessary files onto your machine with Git</p>
        <p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                   href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/introduction-to-git">The Odin
            Project - Introduction to Git</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Git is like a really epic save button for your files and directories. Officially, Git is a version
            control system.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The next few steps have been adapted from <a
                href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/setting-up-git">The Odin Project
            - Configure Git (Linux or Mac) and Github
            (all operating systems)</a></p>
        <p>First, we open a new terminal with the key combination <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> or alternatively search for
            "terminal"</p>
        <img src="assets/open-terminal.png">
        <p>From there, we can run these commands in the terminal to update the Linux system</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
        <p>And to install git</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git</code></pre>
        <p>Now we can configure Git and GitHub. Be sure to enter your own information inside the quotes (but include the
            quotation marks).</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"</code></pre>
        <p>We change Git's default branch (don't worry about the Git terminology here) to main to match GitHub's default
            branch name</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></pre>
        <p>Next, you can go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>
            and
            create an account if you
            don't already
            have one.</p>
        <p>That completes our Git setup.</p>
        <p>After getting our project up and running, to get started with Git I recommend returning <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4">this video by Cory
            Schafer</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                               href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/git-basics">this Git
            lesson on The Odin Project</a>. Try not to feel too overwhelmed by all the commands at this point, as you'll
            soon find out there are only a few commands you'll use in your <strong>basic Git workflow</strong>.</p>
        <p>Now we can get all the files you need to get up and running on your machine.</p>
        <p>The next few steps have been adapted from <a
                href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/"> GitHub Docs - Fork a repo</a></p>
        <p>On GitHub, we go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                      href="https://github.com/barrysweeney/1-click-startup">1 Click
            Startup
            repository</a></p>
        <p>We click to fork the repository, essentially creating a new copy that doesn't affect the original</p>
        <img src="assets/fork.png">
        <p>Now we can clone the forked repository so you have the files available on your machine as well as on your
            GitHub account.</p>
        <p>You can modify the following URL with your GitHub username to find your forked repository:
            <a href="#">https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/1-click-startup</a>
        </p>
        <p>We can click the code button above the list of files</p>
        <img src="assets/code-button.png">
        <p>Next, to clone the repository with HTTPS you can click the clipboard icon to copy the URL (note the URL
            should look like <strong>https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/1-click-startup</strong>)</p>
        <img src="assets/https-clipboard.png">
        <p>Now we can go back to our terminal and type git clone and paste the copied URL with <code>ctrl+shift+v</code>
        </p>
        <p>It should look something like this</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/1-click-startup</code></pre>
        <p>If we hit enter the local clone should be created and we should have all the files we need.</p>
        <h4>Set up Docker and Docker Compose</h4>
        <h5>Set up Docker Engine</h5>
        <p>We'll install Docker so we can run our different services (frontend UI, database, etc) in containers to limit
            the number of services we need to install locally.</p>
        <p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Docker</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its
            environment, solving the “it works on my machine” headache. For millions of developers today, Docker is the
            de
            facto standard to build and share containerized apps"
        </blockquote>
        <p> This guide includes installing Docker engine on Ubuntu. For other operating systems, Linux platforms, and
            alternative install methods, I'll point you to these guides to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/"
            >Install Docker Engine on Linux</a
            ></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/"
            >Install Docker Desktop on MAC</a
            ></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/"
            >Install Docker Desktop on Windows</a
            ></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following steps are adapted from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                   href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Install Docker
            Engine on Ubuntu</a></p>
        <p>If you think you may have some older versions of Docker installed, you can uninstall them with</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc</code></pre>
        <p>Next, we'll set up the Docker repository. First, we'll update the apt package index and install the packages
            that allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \ apt-transport-https \ ca-certificates \ curl \ gnupg-agent \ software-properties-common</code></pre>
        <p>Next we'll add the official Docker GPG key:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg</code></pre>
        <p>And we can set up the stable repository with the following command</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null</code></pre>
        <p>We can now install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update

        <h4>Set up IDE</h4>
        <p>We'll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for the purpose of this guide due to it's versatility; allowing
            us to code JavaScript
            and Python in the same editor.</p>
        <p>You can open up Ubuntu Software which should appear when you start searching for

        <p>As Ubuntu comes with Python3 pre-installed we can move on to installing pip. (For other Operating Systems you
            can see options like brew for MacOS and WSL for Windows in <a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">Getting Started with Python in VS
                Code</a> )</p>
        <p>To install pip...</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install -y python3-pip</code></pre>
        <p>We can now open our Flask code and select our Python interpreter</p>
        <p>From <a
                href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">Getting Started with Python in VS
            Code</a></p>
        <blockquote>"Python is an interpreted language, and in order to run Python code and get Python IntelliSense, you
            must tell VS Code which interpreter to use."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Inside the cloned 1-click-startup repository you'll see a folder "1cs-backend" which you can right click to
            select "open with other application"</p>
        <img src="assets/open-with-vscode.png">
        <p>We can select VS Code, and from here, we can install a virtual environment. Here's what the Visual Studio
            Code
            guide referenced above
            has to say about why virtual environments are important:</p>
        <blockquote>"A best practice among Python developers is to avoid installing packages into a global interpreter
            environment. You instead use a project-specific virtual environment that contains a copy of a global
            interpreter. Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other
            environments. Such isolation reduces many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Within VS Code, you can use <code>ctrl+alt+`</code> to open a terminal, and then type the following to set up
            and
            activate the virtual environment</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate</code></pre>
        <p>We can use <code>ctrl+shift+p</code> to open the command palette and start typing "python:select interpreter"
        </p>
        <img src="assets/python-select-interpreter.png">
        <p>And select our interpreter from the menu (or navigate to the folder on your system)</p>
        <img src="assets/venv-interpreter.png">
        <p>We can install the packages required by our backend code by running the following command within our
            activated virtual environment</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
        <p>That's all the work done to set up our python backend. If you try to run the code now you'll still get errors
            because we are yet to set up our database etc.</p>
        <h4>Run development containers</h4>
        <p>To run our development containers, we'll navigate to where we've cloned the files locally, which can be done
            by
            opening a terminal with <code>ctrl+alt+t</code></p>
        <p>From here, we can change directory to the cloned repository with</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">cd 1-click-startup</code></pre>
        <p>Now, we can run</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo docker-compose up</code></pre>
        <p>The relevant ports are now exposed and can be accessed on your local machine.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Frontend Interface</strong> is accessible at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                                       href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>

        </p>
        <p>Requests are made from the backend to the <strong>MySQL Database</strong> at <a target="_blank"

                                                                                           href="http://localhost:3306">http://localhost:3306</a>
        </p>
        <p>For more control over the database in development, a database graphical interface - <strong>Adminer</strong>
            - is accessible at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
        </p>
        <p>To login we enter our server as "db", username as "root" and password as "p@ssw0rd1"</p>
        <img src="assets/adminer.png">
        <p>This configuration information, as well as other ports exposed for user automation, can be found in the
            <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file at the root of the cloned directory.</p>
        <p>We'll dive a little deeper into this file when we move on to adding a service later, but for now we can take
            a
            quick look, so you get the general idea of how we tell our application which services to start and what port
            to expose them on:</p>
        <img src="assets/compose-yaml.png">
        <p>Essentially, we either provide a path to a Dockerfile to build the service (as done with the backend
            service),
            or we name the image as an existing service we want to use such as with the mysql image (this image is then
            pulled from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>).</p>
        <p>We don't need to worry too much about all of the commands right now as we'll see them again later when we're
            adding a new service.</p>

            Python?</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>"Flask is a web application framework written in Python.

            A Web Application Framework or simply a
            Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and
            modules that enable web application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level
            details"
        </blockquote>
        <p>When a user submits a form or clicks a button on the front-end user interface (in their browser), a request
            is
            made to a certain endpoint on the "backend" webserver. For example, when a user attempts to log in, their
            email
            and password are sent to the Flask webserver which then performs the authentication.</p>
        <p>Let's start running through the code.</p>
        <p>We start by importing the relevant packages, which are either shipped with Python, or installed using pip
            from
            our <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># For handling requests and responses
import json
from flask import Flask, request
# For database connection
import mysql.connector
# For password encryption
from passlib.hash import sha256_crypt
# To enable requests from the frontend user interface
from flask_cors import CORS, cross_origin</code></pre>
        <p>We then create and configure the app</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Create Flask instance
app = Flask(__name__)</code></pre>
        <p>From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        </p>
        <blockquote><code>__name__</code> is the name of the current Python module. The app needs to know where it’s
            located to set up some paths, and <code>__name__</code> is a convenient way to tell it that.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Next, we use the <code>flask_cors</code> module to allow communication between our frontend interface and
            backend webserver.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Enable CORS to permit requests from the frontend to the backend (a different origin)
CORS(app) # Enables CORS for all routes
# Allow Content-Type header

        <blockquote><strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong> (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows
            a server to
            indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading
            of resources
        </blockquote>
        <p>Although we've created a dependency between the MySQL and Flask server containers in the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code>
            file using <code>depends_on</code>, we still need to wait for the MySQL server <em>within</em> the container
            to be ready for connections.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Wait for MYSQL container to be ready for connection before allowing requests to database
ready = False
while not ready:
    try:
        # Connect to db with parameters matching docker-compose.yaml file
        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="db",

        # Try to connect to database again
        continue</code></pre>
        <p>Next we'll look at two routes in a little bit more detail. We'll first look at user registration as an
            introduction to our authentication routes.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Authentication

# User registration route
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
@cross_origin()
def register():
    # Get values from json request body
    data = request.json
    name = data['name']
    email = data['email']
    role = data['role']
    business = data['business']
    # Encrypt plain text password
    password = sha256_crypt.encrypt(data['password'])

    # Connect to db with parameters matching docker-compose.yaml file
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="db",
        user="root",
        password="p@ssw0rd1",
        database="startup"
    )

    # Create cursor
    cursor = mydb.cursor()

    # Execute query to add user to database users table
    cursor.execute(
        "INSERT INTO users(name, email, password, role, business,) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
        (name, email, password, role, business,))

    # Commit data to db
    mydb.commit()

    # Close connection
    cursor.close()
    mydb.close()

    # Return success message
    return json.dumps({'success': True}), 200, {'ContentType': 'application/json'}</code></pre>
        <p>Essentially, what we have above, is that the user will enter their email, password, and business, into a
            form on the frontend. The data is then sent to the flask server, which will store the users details in the
            database.</p>
        <p>Next, we'll take a look at the route used to complete a customer order.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Store new customer order in the database
# TODO: Restrict route to logged in users
# TODO: Link order to business
# TODO: Reduce stock level of ordered items
@app.route('/customer/order/new', methods=['POST'])
@cross_origin()
def customer_order():
    # Get values from json request body
    data = request.json
    customer_name = data['name']
    contact_number = data['number']
    customer_order = data['order']

    # Connect to db with parameters matching docker-compose.yaml file
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="db",
        user="root",
        password="p@ssw0rd1",
        database="startup"
    )

    # Create cursor
    cursor = mydb.cursor()

    # Insert values from form into new record in CUSTOMER_ORDER table
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO customer_order (customer_name, contact_number, customer_order) \
     VALUES (%s,%s,%s)", (customer_name, contact_number, customer_order))

    # Commit data to db
    mydb.commit()

    # Close connection
    cursor.close()
    mydb.close()

    # Return success message
    return json.dumps({'success': True}), 200, {'ContentType': 'application/json'}</code></pre>
        <p>You'll notice some similarities across the routes, as we're typically doing the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extract data from request</li>
            <li>Connect to database</li>
            <li>Interact with database</li>
            <li>Close database connection</li>
            <li>Send response to user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One last thing we'll mention before we move on to adding a new service to the application is the idea of
            extracting data from the URL. For example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python"># Get an employees details from the database using their id
@app.route("/employee/&lt;id&gt;")
def get_employee(id):
    return 'Not yet implemented'</code></pre>
        <p>Using the <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> syntax in the route and having the <code>id</code> as a method parameter
            allows us to
            use <code>id</code> inside the method, which will allow us to search the database by id, for example.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="new-service" id="new-service">

        <p>We set the image to pull from Docker Hub and map the port from within the

        <p>Next, we'll link this service to the custom frontend. We'll want NextCloud to be set up with the apps already
            installed, so we'll create a small Python script to do that.</p>
        <p>We'll create a new folder "pyselenium-admin"</p>

            <h3>📊 Automated Manager</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>We'll also want an automated manager, so that we could simulate a day in the life of a small business.
                The
                jobs that get done, the emails that get sent, the forms that get filled in, etc.</p>

            <h3>⛈ Adding work problems in the application</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>When we're designing our application, we'll also want to introduce realistic problems that could occur
                and
                affect the business operations. This could be anything from employees leaving, to global events
                effecting opening hours.</p>
            <p>In the simulation, we can begin by including problems that are more likely to occur that would affect
                normal operations. These could be implemented with appropriate randomness to make the simulation as
                plausible as possible.</p>
            <p>A simple example might be that someone calls in sick last minute. This will have a domino effect, and it
                will be necessary to respond appropriately. We can map out these problem use cases in a table format as
                we have done with the expected daily business use cases.</p>
            <h4>Example problem use cases</h4>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Situation (When)</th>
                    <th>Motivation (I want to)</th>
                    <th>Expected Outcome (So I can)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Employee calls in sick</td>
                    <td>Ask another employee to cover the shift and update employees hours</td>
                    <td>Update payroll and not be understaffed</td>

                        as well as possible <a href="#adding-problems">problem use

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Email</h4>
                    <p>Adding an email service will allow communication between managers and employees as well as
                        managers and suppliers. The Gmail Python package may be a plausible option for this. An
                        alternative would be an integration with NextCloud's email feature.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Authentication</h4>
                    <p>The app's authentication has been started but it will still be necessary to restrict routes to
                        logged in users, and use access-roles to restrict some routes to managers only.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Persistent Storage</h4>
                    <p>At the minute, our database storage isn't persistent. We could implement persistent data storage
                        by creating a database dump when the user is finished with the application or periodically
                        throughout the day. On startup, the most recent database dump can then be used to create and
                        populate the database.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Payroll</h4>
                    <p>Integration with a payroll service could allow small business owners to easily pay their
                        employees based on their salary and hours worked (which could be queried from the database).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>AI Users</h4>
                    <p>We could introduce the concept of "virtual time" to make our employee perform tasks at an
                        accelerated rate, and record completed tasks in the webapp. In addition to this, we'd also like
                        the
                        employee to
                        perform their tasks based on what work is assigned to them through their custom webapp
                        interface.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Testing</h4>
                    <p>PySelenium could be used to set up automated tests to ensure our system is behaving as
                        expected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Deployment</h4>
                    <p>The main final file to ship to the user is <code>user/start.sh</code> which essentially installs
                        Docker to run the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and installs Firefox to access the
                        frontend
                        interfaces.</p>
