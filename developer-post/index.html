        <h2>Product Vision</h2>
        <p>The end product is a system targeted at a business owner which will setup all the services (file sharing,
            chat, etc) needed to run their business with a single click.
        <p>
        <p>Employees of the business can use the product to help perform their job, log important information, or
            otherwise interact with colleagues and management.</p>
        <p>The product will feature a dashboard, exclusive to the manager, that will allow them to track key
            productivity metrics and highlight employee engagement.</p>
        <p>In this manner, we are digitising the bureaucracy of an organization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-vision">
        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
        <p>The end project will be the technical implication of the product (as described in the vision) using tools
            such as Docker, shell scripts, and a Flask REST API webserver.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we also want to provide a testing framework with simulated users and managers using a
            tool such as PySelenium.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ux">
        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p>We know the what and the how, but our picture is incomplete without understanding who we're developing our
            product for.</p>
        <p>We begin with research to discover our target users and then analyze the gathered data to help define the
            vision of our product. We then take a user-centric approach to design which we then validate.</p>
        <p>Without further ado, let's dive into each of these to see where this missing puzzle piece fits in with
            regards to the project. </p>
        <div class="research">
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that we
                need to define our user and figure out more specific details regarding their current work-flows,
                including the services and platforms they use. We'll also take a look at the approaches being employed
                by others with similarities to our product.</p>
            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <!--            todo: https://www.shopify.co.uk/blog/competitive-analysis-->
            <blockquote>
                “Does it better” will always beat “did it first.” – Aaron Levie, CEO at Box
            </blockquote>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>Research methods can be categorised as either qualitative (open ended questions) or quantitative (close
                ended questions).</p>
            <p>In depth interviews fall on the qualitative side of the line and tend to garner information regarding
                users' attitudes.</p>
            <h4>Surveys</h4>
            <p>In contrast to in-depth interviews, surveys, especially those with no follow-up questions provide
                quantitative data from which we can analyze responses to recognize patterns.</p>
            <p>You can find a report of the survey by opening <a href="assets/usability-report.pdf">this PDF file</a>.

        <div class="analyze">
            <h3>Analyze</h3>
            <p>We can take the raw data we gathered from our research to define our target user's behaviour and
                attitudes.</p>
            <h4>Use Cases</h4>
            <p>Use cases can be defined with a jobs to be done (JTBD) template that follows a situation, motivation,
                expected outcome format</p>

            <h4>User Personas</h4>
            <p>We capture the the common behaviours that meaningfully characterize each user into a persona. In our case
                we'll have a persona for both a manager and an employee since their needs will be very different.</p>

            <h4>Storyboards</h4>
            <h4>User Journeys</h4>
            <p>A user journey map can help us to visualize how users react when using our system. In this case, the sign
                up process has been mapped.</p>

            <h4>Empathy Maps</h4>
            <p>An empathy map can help us compare user behaviour wit their attitudes. We map speculations about a user
                to visualize their potential frustrations and pains.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>When a clear product direction has been established we can begin designs that take into account visual
                aspects but also maintain consistency and prioritize functionality.</p>
            <h4>Mood Boards</h4>
            <h4>Sitemaps</h4>
            <h4>Wireframes</h4>
            <h4>Prototypes</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="validate">
            <p>At this point we can get feedback from the user about our designs. We want our user to have a successful
                interaction and get value from our product. If issues do however arise, we can iterate and make
                improvements by following through the 4 stages of our UX design process.</p>
