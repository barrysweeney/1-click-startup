        <h2>Product Vision</h2>
        <p>The end product is a system targeted at a business owner which will provide them and their employees with an
            interface to perform their business functions.</p>
        <p>Employees of the business can use the product to fill in a series of digital forms which log important
            information about the processes they complete in their work.</p>
        <p>The manager can use the product to complete managerial specific forms relating to accounting and stock
            orders.</p>
        <p>This data will be piped through a process mining application and the results will be forwarded to the
            manager's dashboard.</p>
        <p>This dashboard, exclusive to the manager, will allow them to track key
            productivity metrics and highlight employee engagement, as well as visualize the business processes to
            identify bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>In this manner, we are digitising the bureaucracy of an organization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-vision">
        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
        <p>The end project will be the technical implication of the product (as described in the vision) using tools
            such as Docker, shell scripts, and a Flask REST API webserver.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we also want to provide a testing framework with simulated users and managers using a
            tool such as PySelenium.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prototype">
        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>User experience design details are listed below but for now I feel like it's worth introducing the prototypal
            application.</p>

    <div class="User Experience">
        <h2>User Experience (UX) Design</h2>
        <p>We want to solve problems our user is facing and improve their overall work-flow. In order to do that we
            need to define our user and figure out more specific details regarding their current work-flows,
            including the services and platforms they use. We'll also take a look at the approaches being employed
            by others with similarities to our product.</p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h4>Surveys</h4>
        <p>Surveys, especially those with no follow-up questions, provide
            quantitative data from which we can analyze responses to recognize patterns.</p>
        <p>You can find a report of the survey by opening <a href="assets/usability-report.pdf">this PDF file</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Analyze</h3>
        <p>We can take the raw data we gathered from our interview (transcript omitted for confidentiality) and surveys to define our target user's behaviour and
            attitudes.</p>
        <h4>Use Cases</h4>
        <p>Use cases can be defined with a jobs to be done (JTBD) template that follows a situation, motivation,
            expected outcome format</p>

        <p>We capture the the common behaviours that meaningfully characterize each user into a persona. In our case
            we'll have a persona for both a manager and an employee since their needs will be very different.</p>
